The meat is first fried in oil until the skin is a delicious crispy brown, then stir-fried with onions and other condiments, before adding fermented fruit juice and stewing — and don't forget to add cream once the soup thickens. When ready, every last piece of meat is wrapped uniformly in cream, giving it that warm, familiar flavor that Fontainians love.",
